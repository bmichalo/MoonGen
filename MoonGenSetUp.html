    <h1>MoonGen</h1>
    Note I am a user of the MoonGen application and not the author.  The original code and documentation can be found here: <br><br>
    <a href="https://github.com/emmericp/MoonGen">MoonGen GitHub</a><br><br>
    The follow notes regarding MoonGen installation and execution are meant to be used in concert with the original documenation 
    as detailed within the README file of the above github.  I have modified the MoonGen application slightly to suite my needs - although 
    whole overall process does not deviate too much from the original. 
    <h2>MoonGen Installation Notes</h2>

        <b><li>Bind DPDK to interfaces of interest</li></b>
        <br>
        DPDK bypasses the native Linux networking stack and uses a userspace poll mode driver to transmit and receive packets from the wire.  This is known as 
        a "pass through mode".  There are at least a few flavors of kernel drivers that will enable this packet pass through:
        <br>
        <br>
        <dl>
            <dt><b>uio_pci_generic</b></dt>
            <dd>Generic User I/O kernel modules packaged with Linux kernel</dd>
            <dt><b>igb_uio</b></dt>
            <dd>User I/O kernel modules packaged with MoonGen (within the DPDK dependency).  igb_uio built within MoonGen dependencies and Intel specific</dd>
            <dt><b>vfio-pci</b></dt>
            <dd>A more secure User I/O kernel driver that utilizes IOMMU hardware.  If using an Intel processor with IOMMU 
                supported hardware, the kernel bootloader parameter 'intel_iommu=on' must be added and can be again done using the 'grubby' utility  (grubby --update-kernel=`grubby --default-kernel` --args="intel_iommu=on") and then reboot</dd>
        </dl>
        <br>
        It is recommended that if hardware support for IOMMU is there, use vfio-pci.  If not, use uio_pci_generic or igb_uio.  One way to determine if IOMMU support is 
        present is to look into the kernel log:<br>
        <pre>
        [root@perf84 ~]# dmesg | grep -i IOMMU
        [    0.000000 ] Intel-IOMMU: enabled
        </pre>
        Determine the PCI 'Doman:Bus:Device:Function' information for the interfaces which you want to use MoonGen (and thus bind DPDK).  This can be done 
        via the 'ethtool' (yum install ethtool) utility via 'ethtool -i <interface_name>', e.g.:
        <pre>
        [root@perf36 MoonGen]# ethtool -i em1 | grep 'bus-info'
        bus-info: 0000:01:00.0
        [root@perf36 MoonGen]# ethtool -i em2 | grep 'bus-info'
        bus-info: 0000:01:00.1
        </pre>
        where in this case network devices 'em1' and 'em2' are both 10G capable ports where its desired to use MoonGen to TX/RX traffic.
        <br>
        This can also be seen via the DPDK utility 'dpdk_nic_bind.py' again under MoonGen's DPDK dependency directory:
        <br>
        <pre>
        [root@perf36 MoonGen]# ./deps/dpdk/tools/dpdk_nic_bind.py --status

        Network devices using DPDK-compatible driver
        ============================================
        &ltnone&gt

        Network devices using kernel driver
        ===================================
        0000:01:00.0 '82599ES 10-Gigabit SFI/SFP+ Network Connection' if=em1 drv=ixgbe unused= 
        0000:01:00.1 '82599ES 10-Gigabit SFI/SFP+ Network Connection' if=em2 drv=ixgbe unused= 
        0000:03:00.0 'Ethernet Controller XL710 for 40GbE QSFP+' if=p3p1 drv=i40e unused= 
        0000:03:00.1 'Ethernet Controller XL710 for 40GbE QSFP+' if=p3p2 drv=i40e unused= 
        0000:05:00.0 'I350 Gigabit Network Connection' if=em3 drv=igb unused= *Active*
        0000:05:00.1 'I350 Gigabit Network Connection' if=em4 drv=igb unused= 

        Other network devices
        =====================
        &ltnone&gt
        </pre>

        Use 'dpdk_nic_bind.py' to unbind network devices from current drivers.  In this case, its ixgbe.  Before doing the unbind, shutdown the interfaces.
        <br>
        <pre>

        [root@perf36 MoonGen]# ifdown em1 
        [root@perf36 MoonGen]# ifdown em2 
        [root@perf36 MoonGen]# ./deps/dpdk/tools/dpdk_nic_bind.py --unbind 0000:01:00.0 0000:01:00.1

        </pre>

        Again using 'dpdk_nic_bind.py', bind DPDK to the interfaces to be used with MoonGen.  In this case, the two 10G network devices will be used:<br>

        <pre>
        [root@perf36 MoonGen]# modprobe vfio-pci
        [root@perf36 MoonGen]# 
        [root@perf36 MoonGen]# ./deps/dpdk/tools/dpdk_nic_bind.py --bind=vfio-pci 0000:01:00.0 0000:01:00.1
        </pre>

        And now we can see that the 10G network devices are bound to the appropriate DPDK supported driver:
        <br>
        <pre>
        [root@perf36 MoonGen]# ./deps/dpdk/tools/dpdk_nic_bind.py --status
        
        Network devices using DPDK-compatible driver

        0000:01:00.1 '82599ES 10-Gigabit SFI/SFP+ Network Connection' drv=vfio-pci unused=
        
        Network devices using kernel driver
        ===================================
        0000:03:00.0 'Ethernet Controller XL710 for 40GbE QSFP+' if=p3p1 drv=i40e unused=vfio-pci 
        0000:03:00.1 'Ethernet Controller XL710 for 40GbE QSFP+' if=p3p2 drv=i40e unused=vfio-pci 
        0000:05:00.0 'I350 Gigabit Network Connection' if=em3 drv=igb unused=vfio-pci *Active*
        0000:05:00.1 'I350 Gigabit Network Connection' if=em4 drv=igb unused=vfio-pci

        *     The validation of 14.80 Mfps passed because the traffic throughput loss was 0.00000000 %, 
        *     which did not exceed the maximum allowed (1.00 %) loss
